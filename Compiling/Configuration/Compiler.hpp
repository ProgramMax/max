// The order of these is important.
// Clang defines both __clang__ and __GNUC__.
// GCC does not define __clang__.
// So the GCC check must come after the Clang check.
// ICC also defines __GNUC__.
// So the check for __ICC must also come before the GCC check.
// Metrowerks and MSVC both define _MSC_VER.
// So check __MWERKS__ prior to checking _MSC_VER.
